## How to participate

Each project idea lists the mentors with their contact information at the end.

We encourage you to get in contact with the mentors and the Perl / Raku community as early as possible.
Talking with the mentors about the projects you are interested in is the fastest way to get a good
understanding of the project. And that is the most important step for a good application and successful
project.

If you are a student and have a project idea not listed above, feel free to
contact the organization administrators and just ask!

Google offers some very good documentation for Summer of Code. If you haven't already you should really
[head over to it](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Make sure you don't miss

- [How it works](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/)
- the [FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq)
- and the [Student Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/)


## Contact the Raku community

In general the Raku community is most active on IRC. Just drop by on the
[#raku](https://webchat.freenode.net/#raku) Freenode channel and say Hello!

If you prefer email, head over to the [mailing lists](https://raku.org/archive/lists/).
The [perl6-users mailing list](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.users/) is the one you
probably want to use.


## Contact the Perl community

Here's a list of [Perl mailing lists](https://lists.perl.org/), with
[this Perl specific list for beginners](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.beginners/).
Perl has its own IRC hosting site, with [this list of channels](http://www.irc.perl.org/channels.html).
`#perl-help` is the best place for beginners.
